imax-title3=SOUND YOU CAN FEEL
imax-title3-desc1=Huge explosion. Whisper in your ear. The booming bass you feel more than hear. \
 The combination of the perfectly tuned 12-channel audio system and the precise positioning of the speakers, \
 ensures that you will not only be able to hear the sound of a pin falling, but also determine exactly where it has fallen.

imax-title4=BREATHTAKING PICTURE
imax-title4-desc1=Clarity, detail and size make IMAX movies different. Our remastering or DMR process completely \
 transforms every frame of the film to create the best possible version of the director's vision. Two spotlights \
 work simultaneously to deliver the perfect image with a balance of warmth and sharpness.

imax-title5=AN IMMERSIVE EXPERIENCE
imax-title5-desc1=The movies are to be watched. But watching a movie in IMAX® is so much more. It's called the IMAX Experience®. \
 Every element in our IMAX is planned, designed and positioned to create the most intense experience. \
 The hall's special geometry creates cinematic magic every time the lights go down.

imax-title6=CINEMATOGRAPHY
imax-title6-desc1=MAX cameras have been on top of Mount Everest, at the bottom of the ocean, and even in space. For 40 years now, \
  they push the boundaries of engineering and are known worldwide as the best filmmaking equipment available today.

imax-title7=IMAX SCREEN
imax-title7-desc1=Its height is 14 meters and its length is 24 meters. It is made of a special diffused silver vinyl, \
 perforated with thousands of tiny holes to allow sound to pass freely, so-called "acoustic transparency". \
 The screen is flat, but has a slight arc that's out of peripheral vision. This, combined with a 23 degree seat angle, \
 provides full and undisturbed visibility from every seat in the cinema hall. Even if a two-meter person is sitting in front of you, \
 you will see without any problem. The 3D effect of IMAX 3D technology is recognized as the best 3D in the world.

4-dx-title1=CINEMA EXPERIENCE
4-dx-title2=4DX - ENTER THE MOVIE
4-dx-title2-desc1=4DX® is the movie industry's biggest and newest superhero for a fully immersive cinematic experience.
4-dx-title2-desc2=The four-dimensional technology was created in South Korea in 2009, and entered Europe in 2013. \
 With it, the effects stimulate the viewers' senses far beyond the limits of the audiovisual experience in standard movie theaters. \
 Each film title comes to the screen with a unique choreography and mixture of air, water, aroma, movement, vibrations, \
 that happen in sync with the action on the screen. The experienced team of 4DX® experts will make you a part of every movie, \
 without violating the natural boundaries of your comfort zone. Break free from limitations and enjoy the ultimate 4DX® experience.
